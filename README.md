## Overview

Youâ€™re thinking about moving to Hawaii and opening a business combining a surf shop with an ice cream store. Will it be a success? Well, you need to do some data analysis to help you answer that question. In this analysis you look at temperatures for 2 different parts of the year (June and December) from 2010-2016. Once the dates are chosen, summary statistics are calculated to help you decide if the shop will be a success.

## Results

The results are below. In the stats you will see the following:

*mean temperatures for June (75) and december (71) are only 4 degrees different 
*maximum temperatures are even closer with 85 in June and 83 in December
*biggest difference: minimum temperatures with 64 in June and 56 in December 

This may mean that the shop could close earlier in the winter since it will be colder at night.

## Summary

Looking at the temperatures for 2 months during different times of the year does provide good information. But deciding to leave your home and move to Hawaii based solely on this information may be a bit risky. I would suggest looking at the temperatures and precipitation for all 12 months, both separately and as a whole.
